# docker-mini

This repo defines a small image `zppz/mini` that contains tools for my Docker workflow.

This image is the next step after [`zppz/tiny`](https://github.com/zpz/docker-tiny). While `zppz/tiny` is quite stable, `zppz/mini` may evolve relatively fast. The stable image `zppz/tiny` contains commands, among other tools, that find the latest image `zppz/mini`.

In addition, this repo defines a script [`run-docker`](./sbin/run-docker).
