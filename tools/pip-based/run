# In the root directory of a Python project repo, there is a script called `run`.
# This script prepares a few env vars, then run the current script.
#
# The code relies on `pyproject.toml` to specify dependencies and various project info.
# A Dockerfile is generated on the fly.
# The Python package being developed in the repo is installed with all its mandatory and optional
# dependencies. The the repo package itself is uninstalled, leaving the dependencies installed.
#
# The Docker image built is named zppz/<pkg>:dev
#
# Subsequently, the behavior depends on what Git branch is current.
#
# If branch is `main` or `master` or `release`,
# then all tests are run.
# If the branch is `release`, it further makes a release of the package.
# The release artifacts will appear in `dist/` under the root of the repo.
#
# If branch is any other, then it is assumed user is doing development.
# `run-docker` is used to determine all kinds of `docker-run` settings and finally
# launch a container based on the newly built image, landing within the container
# ready for development runs. The repo directory is volume-mapped into the container,
# hence any test runs will use the latest code on the hosting machine.
# You can edit code outside of the container, then run tests inside the container.

# The Python package name is defined in `pyproject.toml`.
# It is usually the name of the directory under `src/` but it does not have to be.
# Here we infer it from the directory name rather than from `pyproject.toml`
# because the latter approch requires both Python and toml.
# The env var `$PROJ` is passed into the container and is used by `run-tests`.
# On the other hand, infer package name properly from `pyproject.toml` in Dockerfile.
